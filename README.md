FoodLoop - Food Waste Management System

FoodLoop is a web-based application designed to reduce food waste by facilitating the donation of surplus food from individuals, restaurants, weddings, and events to NGOs, communities, or people in need. The platform is a part of a government initiative and offers a minimal payment as an incentive to food donors.

Admin Module:
Manages food donations.
Tracks donations and ensures they are properly assigned and delivered.


Delivery Module:
Provides pickup and drop-off services for the donated food.
Ensures timely and safe transportation of food items.
